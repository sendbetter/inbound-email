# Inbound Email (SMTP) to Webhook

Author: [Martin Alexander](https://martinalexander.me/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-alexander)

A simple, efficient script that provides an SMTP server to receive emails, parse content (including headers), store attachments in Amazon S3, and forward email content to a webhook. Graceful handling of multiple concurrent SMTP sessions and webhook requests.

## Features

- SMTP server to receive emails concurrently
- Parses incoming emails using `mailparser`
- Uploads attachments to Amazon S3
- Forwards parsed email content to a specified webhook
- Configurable via environment variables
- Handles large attachments gracefully
- Robust queue system for processing multiple emails and webhook requests simultaneously

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- If saving attachments, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with S3 access or a compatible system
- A HTTP(s) webhook endpoint to receive the processed emails

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sendbetter/inbound-email.git
   cd inbound-email
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the required configuration: (eg. `mv .env.example .env`)
   - `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum size of attachments to process, in bytes (default: 5MB)
   - `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key
   - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket for storing attachments
   - `PORT`: The port for the SMTP server to listen on (default: 25)
   - `WEBHOOK_URL`: The URL where parsed emails will be sent (required)
   - `SMTP_SECURE`: Set to 'true' for TLS support (default: false)
   - `WEBHOOK_CONCURRENCY`: Number of concurrent webhook requests (default: 5)

## Usage

Start the server:
```
npm start
```

The SMTP server will start and listen on the specified port (default: 25) on all network interfaces.

You can use pm2 or supervisor to keep the server running after restart. Example: `pm2 start server.js`

## Sample Use Cases

1. **Email to Ticket System**: Use this bridge to receive support emails and automatically create tickets in your helpdesk system via the webhook.

2. **Document Processing**: Receive emails with document attachments, store them in S3, and trigger a document processing pipeline through the webhook.

3. **Email Marketing Analysis**: Collect incoming emails from a campaign, store any images or attachments, and send the content to an analytics system for processing.

4. **Automated Reporting**: Set up an email address that receives automated reports, stores them in S3, and notifies your team via the webhook.

5. **DMARC Reporting**: Receive DMARC reports via email and store them in S3.

Using inbound parse for something interesting? Please let me know, I'd love to hear about it.
